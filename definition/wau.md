title: WAU (Weekly active user)
---

### Definition

WAU is an abbreviation for "Weekly Active User". This metric is typically used for understanding how often users return to a service. If a user comes to a service one day a week, they would be considered a WAU. If a user comes several times during a week, their status as a WAU remains unchanged. When looking for a more frequent measure of user activity [DAUs](/definition/dau) can be monitored.
