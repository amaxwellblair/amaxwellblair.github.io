title: DAU (Daily active user)
---

### Definition

DAU is an abbreviation for **D**aily **A**ctive **U**ser. This metric is typically used for understanding how often users return to a service. In the case of a website if a user comes to the site everyday they would be considered a DAU. If the same user only comes once a week they would only be considered a DAU the day they visited. For that specific week they would also be considered a [WAU](wau).

### Practical use
The DAU metric is mostly used in relation to other user counts e.g. total users, [MAUs](mau). The most common question DAU is used to answer is *what percentage of the user base is active?* which could be answered with:

    DAU / Total users

    DAU = 10
    Total users = 100

    % DAUs = 10%

This measure shows how users engage with a service. The example above shows a low DAU percentage which means only some users are coming back daily. Having a high DAU % is almost universally a good sign that the service is well used but a low DAU % doesn't necessarily mean the service is poor. Some services only have a weekly or monthly use case. For example a weekend ride sharing app probably would only have DAUs on the weekend.

<!-- This raises another concern for DAU metrics is their built in cyclicality. To use the same weekend ride share app as an example they -->
